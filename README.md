==============
Just checking out the per-organization RSS feeds offered up by RSportz 1.0 in prep for the JOs/FIRS.  


#### Games Feed
Everything under `description` is a a chunk of HTML elements with the appropriate [XML Character References](XML_character_references).  We can make this work.

#### Recent Results Feed
Much like Games, everthing under `description` is a chunk of HTML elements.  Unfortunately, the feed is invalid--showing `<` and `>` instead of `&lt;` and `&gt;`.  We can still make this work.

---

#### Recent News Feed
Pretty straightforward.  We can make this work if necessary.
