==============
PHP implementation of the per organization RSS feeds offered up by RSportz 1.0.

#### Games Feed
Everything under `description` is a chunk of HTML elements with the appropriate [XML Character References](XML_character_references).  We can make this work.

---

#### Recent Results Feed
Much like Games, everthing under `description` is a chunk of HTML elements.  The feed is showing `<` and `>` instead of `&lt;` and `&gt;`.  Which, interestingly enough, makes it easier to target elements and style them.

---

#### Recent News Feed
Pretty straightforward.  We can make this work if necessary.
